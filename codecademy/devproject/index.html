   <h1>Conrad Gregory</h1> 
<p>Welcome one and all, to my second ever website.</p>
<p>This site is coded from scratch from a text editor. The only unoriginal authoring will be the boilerplate created automatically by <em>VSCode</em></p>
<p>Why am I doing this?</p>
<ol>
    <li>To learn to code.</li>
    <li>To change career.</li>
    <li>To become a developer.</li>
    <li>To have a better quality of life and spend more time with my family.</li>
    <li>To have a job that I enjoy and provides me with a long, lost, creative output!</li>
</ol>
<p>There's gonna be <a href="https://media.makeameme.org/created/exciting-times-ahead.jpg" target="_blank"> exciting times ahead</a></p></o>
