		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This 'fake' pizza recipe is a made with a ketogenic friendly, low carb, dough, primarily based on Almond flour, Mozzarella and egg. While not a full replacement for the classic favourite, it hits real close when carb-cravings hit!</p>
		
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
			<li>140g grated Mozzarella or mild Cheddar (or a mix of both - 100g is for the 'dough' the rest is for toppings)</li>
			<li>100g finely ground Almond flour</li>
			<li>pinch of garlic granules</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
			<li>pinch of Oregano</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon of soft (cream) cheese</li>
			<li>1 can of chopped tomato</li>
			<li>2 or 3 eggs</li>
			<li>Toppings of your choice! 
				<ul>
					<li>Some of my favourite suggestions would be Tomato sauce base, Pepperoni, Basil, Mushrooms</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat your overn to 190 degrees Celsius.</li>
			<li>Mix the almond flour, 100g of your grated cheese (keeping 40g aside for toppings), the garlic granules, baking powder and oregano together in a large, microwaveable bowl.</li>
			<li>Place this mixture in the Microwave at full power for 1.5-2mins. It's worth stopping to check it and mix it halfway through. You want the cheese to melt and help to bind the flour.</li>
			<li>While the flour and cheese mixture is in the microwave, combine your egg and soft cheese in another bowl.</li>
			<li>Once your flour and cheese mixture is nicely melted and combined, go ahead and add in your egg and soft cheese mix. Work the two mixtures together to create dough like combination.</li>
			<li> Use a spatula (silicon is highly recommended for this) to transfer your 'dough' onto a greased, or parchement lined baking sheet and form it into a smooth, flat, pizza base looking shape; whether that be a circle or a square is entirely your choice!</li>
			<li> Once you're happy with your base, just grease the crust edges lightly with some of your olive oil, then bake in the preheated oven for 10-15minutes until starting to become golden.</li>
			<li>Remove from the oven and add the toppings of your choice, that can include a tomato passata base first if you wish, or not if you are really counting your carbs today.</li>
			<li>Place your constructed Pizza back in the oven for approximately another 10 minutes or until your toppings are suitable cooked/melted/browned</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
