** Odin Recipies**

A beginner html project for [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com 'The Odin Project open source Web Dev course') open source web dev course.

It's time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have aquired so far in this early stage. In this project, I am to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipies. The website isn't intended to look 'pretty' at this stage.

It is important to bare in mind that this project is just to build HTML fluency and will likely be revisited with CSS as a later stage.
